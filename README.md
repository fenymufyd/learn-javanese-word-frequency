Learn Javanese (basa Jawa) and Javanese script (aksara Jawa) by memorizing them with Anki. Word frequency table also provided in .csv and .txt

# How to install and learn?
* Install (Anki)[https://apps.ankiweb.net/] if you haven't already
* Download the .apkg file
* Drag and Drop the downloaded file into Anki or click File > Import top left window

# Notes
* Words are processed from jv.wikisource.org books and id.wiktionary.org, Which probably derived from bausastra-jawa-poerwadarminta-1939 book.
* Because some of the books are ancient fossil so old spellings may have distorted the frequency ranking by a bit.
* I'm NOT Javanese. I created this to learn the language myself, thus ⬇️
* The list can be incorrect or incomplete. If you do find mistakes or wanna send suggestions please report them or submit improvements
* Thanks
